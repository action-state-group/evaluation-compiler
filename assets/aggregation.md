# Cross-case aggregation execution

The agent executing a generated **aggregation** skill owns this workflow. It runs
only after per-case evaluation reports exist: its input is `evaluation-report/v1`
Capsules, never source interactions. Use Capsule CLI commands from
`capsule-cli.md` and ordinary file operations. Do not create runners, helper
programs, scripts or Makefiles. Do not edit the generated bundle; corrections
belong in the compiler and require regeneration.

Aggregation reduces many completed judgments into one summary; it never re-judges.
The per-case `aggregate` inside each report is the within-case roll-up across that
run's axes. This skill produces the orthogonal **cross-case** roll-up across many
runs and publishes it as a new `evaluation-summary/v1` Capsule.

## Select and verify the reports

Resolve the runtime profile and the requested range or append-time window. Enumerate
CLL pages and freeze the exact selected entries. Get each Capsule and verify its
identity, trusted producer signature and bound payload before reading its judgments.
A failed or missing required verification is an execution error that drops that report
from the set with an explicit reason; it is not counted as any axis status.

Accept only `evaluation-report/v1` Capsules. Skip and record any other spec version,
and skip a report produced by a different bundle (different `axes` digest) rather than
mixing incomparable axes into one rate.

A shared `axes` digest makes the questions comparable but does not by itself make the
cases one cohort. Establish and enforce a **cohort**: the contributing reports must
describe the same evaluated subject (system/model/config) and dataset revision — read
those from each report's subject/source identity and reject or explicitly group mixed
cohorts rather than blending them into one rate. Deduplicate by a unique **case/trial
key** (e.g. `case.task_id` + `case.trial`): if the same case/trial appears in more than
one report, keep one deterministically (e.g. the highest-sequence report) or reject the
set — never count a case twice. Freeze the contributing set: report Capsule IDs, their
sequences, the shared `axes` digest, the cohort identity, and three distinct counts:
the report count, the unique case/trial count (after dedup), and the unique case count
(e.g. a tau2 4-trial run backfilled per trial has more case/trial reports than tasks).

## Reduce the judgments

Read each report's `axis_judgments` only. Do not re-open the source interactions,
re-extract outcomes, or import raw source data — the reports are the evidence. Each
judgment also carries an `outcome_id` grouping it under an outcome, but cross-case
reduction is **per-axis** over the shared `axes` regardless, so the grouping and the
reports' per-outcome aggregates do not change these counts.

For every axis in the shared `axes`:
- Count `pass`, `fail`, `unjudgeable` and `not_applicable` across the contributing
  reports.
- The applicable denominator excludes `not_applicable`. `pass_rate = pass /
  (pass + fail + unjudgeable)`. `unjudgeable` never counts as `pass`; report it
  explicitly so an unresolved check cannot inflate the rate.

Then compute the cross-case roll-up named by `cross_case_aggregation`. This policy is
**independent of the within-case `aggregation`**: reduce from each report's
`axis_judgments` (and, for `native`, its recorded native result) directly — never from
the report's within-case `aggregate`, which is `null` whenever the per-case policy was
`none`.
- `rate` — the per-axis pass rates above, with no single overall number.
- `all_required` — the fraction of contributing cases that pass, reconstructed here from
  each report's flat `axis_judgments` into the two-level within-case rule (never from the
  stored `aggregate`, so it still works when the per-case policy was `none`): group the
  judgments by `outcome_id`, drop `not_applicable` axes, and mark each **required** outcome
  a pass only if its remaining required axes are a **nonempty** set that are all `pass`
  (any `fail` or `unjudgeable` fails the outcome; a required outcome with no applicable
  required axis is not a pass). The case passes only if its **required** outcomes are a
  nonempty set that all pass; axes of optional outcomes do not affect the case result. The
  shared `axes` metadata supplies each axis's `outcome_id` and the `role` of every axis and
  outcome.
- `native` — the benchmark's resolved scoring contract (e.g. tau2 `pass^k`), applied to
  the native result recorded in each report, grouped by the case/trial key so the
  benchmark's task/trial semantics are preserved; do not invent a substitute score.
  `native` requires every contributing report to carry that native result; if the
  per-case reports do not record it, `native` is unavailable and the compiler must
  reject the configuration rather than emit an undefined score.

Record the same three counts (report count, unique case/trial count, unique case count),
the dropped/skipped reports with reasons, and any axis whose applicable denominator is
zero (reported, not silently passed).

## Publish and verify the summary

Create a new aggregation identity for this run. Record the aggregation bundle's
instructional-file digests, the shared `axes` digest, and the CLI digest, plus the
source store/namespace/log, the frozen contributing report set and the resolved
`cross_case_aggregation` policy. These identify the reducer that produced this
summary; never manufacture historical provenance.

Write one `evaluation-summary/v1` JSON payload holding: aggregation identity, source
selection (store/log and contributing report Capsule IDs + sequences), bundle
provenance, the shared axes digest, per-axis counts and rates, the resolved roll-up,
the dropped/skipped reports, verification references and limitations.

Prepare a `capsule-seal-request/v1` request as specified in `capsule-cli.md`; AAC
digest inputs reject floating-point numbers, so encode rates and any decimal metadata
as decimal strings. A summary reduces many reports, so it binds them with a fan-in
`references[]` array, never a single-parent `chain` block. Add one `References` entry per
contributing report: `CitationPurpose` is `acted_on`, `Digest` is that report's
`capsule_id`, and `LogCoordinates` carries the report's `LogID`, its ledger sequence as
`LeafIndex`, and its `InclusionProof` when available. These references commit the exact
contributing set into the summary's `capsule_id` under format 4, so adding, dropping, or
swapping a report breaks verification, and the bundle walker follows every edge from the
summary to each report (and onward, through each report's own `references[]`, to the
interaction acts). Keep enumerating the same contributing report Capsule IDs and sequences
in the payload's source selection for the human-readable record, but the binding that
commits into `capsule_id` is `references[]`. The report→interaction link is itself a
`references[]` (`acted_on`) edge, not a chain, so no single-parent chain appears anywhere
in this evaluation provenance graph. Call `capsulectl publish`, then get the returned
summary Capsule, verify its identity/signature/trust and bound payload, confirm it carries
one `acted_on` reference per contributing report (each `digest` and `log_coordinates.leaf_index`
matching a verified report in the frozen set), and read back its sequence from the target
CLL. The summary is itself an appended, checkpointable, witnessable Capsule.
Keep run data outside the distributed bundle. Report the summary Capsule ID/sequence,
the contributing set, and any dropped reports or zero-denominator axes.
