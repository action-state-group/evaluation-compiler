# The four skills

This directory holds the `SKILL.md`/`AGENTS.md` text for the skills this repository is
growing into: the evolution of the existing compiler, and the two cron-run skills it
compiles. The two cron skills run (see "Running the two cron skills"). It is additive — the
repository's root `SKILL.md` (the `evaluation-compiler` skill, still live and still the thing
generated bundles are exercised against) is untouched; retiring it and moving its assets is a
separate, later step.

## The four skills, and where each one lives

| # | Skill | Here | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `evidence-contract-compile` | [`evidence-contract-compile/SKILL.md`](evidence-contract-compile/SKILL.md) | drafted, unwired |
| 2 | `daily-judge-and-close` | [`daily-judge-and-close/SKILL.md`](daily-judge-and-close/SKILL.md) | runnable: `scripts/run_daily.py` |
| 3 | `weekly-blind-expert` | [`weekly-blind-expert/SKILL.md`](weekly-blind-expert/SKILL.md) | runnable: `scripts/run_weekly.py` |
| 4 | `capsulectl` (thin verb skill) | **not here** | ships with `capsule-cli` at `skills/capsulectl/`, generated from `spec.yaml` |

Skill 4 is consumed, not vendored. Nothing in this repo copies its `SKILL.md`/`AGENTS.md` or
`spec.yaml` — a customer installs `capsulectl` and gets that skill with it. Duplicating the
files here would create a second copy that drifts from the binary it describes.

## Why skills 1–3 are not `spec.yaml`-rendered

`capsule-cli` renders skills from a `skill-spec/v0` document (`skills/SKILL-SPEC.md` there), so
that `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` come out byte-identical from one source. That format is scoped,
by its own text, to thin tool-calling skills:

> "A **thin, tool-calling skill** — the shape this format is for — may call verbs, validate a
> contract, request evidence, verify a bundle, or inspect a result. It never reasons about
> business meaning... Contrast a **reasoning-heavy** skill (a compiler that decomposes a value
> proposition into axes and writes new instructions) — that shape does not fit this
> schema... See `evaluation-compiler`'s `SKILL.md`."

`evidence-contract-compile` *is* that reasoning-heavy compiler (it is `evaluation-compiler`,
evolved). `daily-judge-and-close` and `weekly-blind-expert` judge, sample, and blind a human —
also reasoning, not a closed verb list. Forcing any of the three into `skill-spec/v0` would mean
either misstating their verb surface or stripping the reasoning out.

So all three are hand-authored `SKILL.md` prose, in the same voice and rigor as the existing
`evaluation-compiler` skill, with `AGENTS.md` a literal byte-identical copy — Claude Code and
Codex read the same text. Only skill 4 goes through `skillgen`, because only skill 4 is thin.
This is the intended pattern for reasoning-heavy skills: hand-authored `SKILL.md`, with
`AGENTS.md` a byte-identical copy.

## Running the two cron skills

Both run with `capsulectl` built from `capsule-cli` main, over a jsonl profile whose one log
is its evidence book. Each has an exercise script that performs exactly the skill's steps,
calling only the verbs the skill lists:

```sh
# nightly: judge yesterday's cases, seal one report per case, seal the day's Close
python3 scripts/run_daily.py --profile NAME --spec COMPILED.json \
    --judge-cmd "PINNED_JUDGE_COMMAND" --judge-model-id MODEL_ID --date YYYY-MM-DD --out RUN_DIR
# weekly: seal the sample, then pause (exit 3) for the human's blind ratings ...
python3 scripts/run_weekly.py --profile NAME --spec COMPILED.json --date YYYY-MM-DD --out RUN_DIR
# ... and resume with them: ratings, calibration summary (k of n), the week's Close
python3 scripts/run_weekly.py --profile NAME --spec COMPILED.json --date YYYY-MM-DD --out RUN_DIR --ratings RATINGS.json
```

`demo/tau2/compiled.json` is the compiled spec for the tau2 airline demo. The judge is any
command that reads one case on stdin and prints `{"verdict", "rationale"}`; no model runs in
this repository. `tests/fresh_env.sh` runs both skills end to end on the tau2 airline book
from a clean machine state (a new HOME, fresh clones, `capsulectl` built from source), with
`tests/stub_judge.py` and `tests/stub_rater.py` as deterministic stand-ins for the judge and
the human, and verifies every record and bundle it produced.

Still pending: the `capsulectl-engine` plugin (`fold run --clause ID --profile NAME`) for
`tier: recomputed` clauses, so a contract with such a clause cannot run the daily skill yet.

## Record family — named here, not defined here

`contract-compile/v1`, `evaluation-report/v1`, `close/v1`, `sample-manifest/v1`,
`human-rating/v1`, `calibration-summary/v1` are referenced below by name and shape only. Their
JSON schemas belong to the judge record family spec; this repo does not define or fork a second
copy, and record names are kept in step with the monthly aggregation stage that consumes them.

## Calibration is k of n

`calibration-summary/v1` reports agreement as k of n, never a score. The estimators in
`docs/calibration-sampling-spec.md` are marked superseded there; its sampling rule stays.

## Not yet done

Retiring the older compiler and judge programs, the root `SKILL.md` cutover, and the
`capsulectl-engine` plugin for recomputed clauses.
